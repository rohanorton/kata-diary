# Roman Numeral Kata

Another simple exercise.

Got a bit confused about ranges which are written `1..10` not `[1..10]`.
Otherwise very trivial to implement.

## 10/07/16: Update

I added a numeral decoder. Learnt a bit about pattern matching with guards and
after a handful of tests implemented a property test using excheck.

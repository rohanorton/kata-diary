# BowlingGame

My second attempt at the bowling kata in elixir. Still not entirely happy with
it, my module feels a bit cluttered and weird. Not sure pattern matching works
fantastically in this scenario, but feel that I've more concretely succeeded in
fulfilling the spec and the code feels more self documenting. It's not as neat
as OOP versions of this kata that I've tried, but this is probably due to my
inexperience programming in this particular paradigm. Hopefully a bit more
practice and experience will improve things again.

# BowlingGame

Really not very happy with how this went. I just about managed to get all tests
passing, though am not convinced by the solution. I also wanted to refactor to
make conditional stuff clearer, but don't think it's possible in case statement.

I think this is a problem that I'd like to revisit in elixir after getting a bit
more comfortable with the language.

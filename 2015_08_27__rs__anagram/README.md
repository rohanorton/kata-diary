Is it an anagram???
===================

Rust is a really fascinating language and a total headscratcher at times. It
feels like you're in constant battle with the compiler. I'm quite pleased to
have even managed this simple task!

Basically, it's a function that takes two words and tells you if they're
anagrams of each other.

I'm a total beginner when it comes to Rust, and many of the things I'm doing
here are probably stupid / wrong, but the tests are all green :)

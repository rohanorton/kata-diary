# Anagram

My first attempt at writing elixir code. Solving this problem felt very
intuitive coming from scripting languages like javascript and ruby (none of the
issues that I had trying the same kata in rust last year!)

Completed the task in about 20 minutes -- not terrible considering this is the
first time I've used elixir. Certainly learned a couple of things along the way:

1. defining and invoking methods(?) on a module
2. regular expression syntax

It also helped that I'd already come across the difference between strings and
char-lists in my reading, which I think would have been a head-scratcher
otherwise.
